# stack-design-team

This repo tracks requests, documentation, and feedback for projects worked by the Stack Design team.

## Need design support?
Great, let's talk. First, a bit about the domain of projects our team handles:
1. Pretty much anything under the 'Analytics' section of Kibana (e.g. Discover, Dashboard, Lens, Visualize Library, Canvas, etc.)
2. A bunch of stuff under Stack Management (working with the Elasticsearch UI team, Kibana Security, Kibana Core, etc.)
3. Global UX/UI concerns in Kibana such as the left navigation, header, and home page
4. Platform-level projects such as alerting, runtime fields, index patterns everywhere, etc.

If your project fits into one of these categories, then ![submit an issue](https://github.com/elastic/stack-design-team/issues/new/choose) using the Design project request template. Not certain if your project is a fit? Reach out to us on Slack at #kibana-design.
